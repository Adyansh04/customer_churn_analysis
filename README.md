This repository contains code for a data analysis project where we use machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The code is written in Python and consists of several sections that are explained in detail below.

Overview
The telecom industry is highly competitive, and companies need to retain their customers to stay ahead. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers leave a company, is a critical metric that affects the company's revenue and growth. In this project, we aim to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques.

We have used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle that contains information about telecom customers, including their demographic information, usage patterns, and account information. We have preprocessed the data by removing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing the numerical features. Next, we split the data into training and testing sets and applied several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.

We have used k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance of each algorithm and selected the best one based on the accuracy score. To further improve the model's performance, we have used hyperparameter tuning to fine-tune the model's parameters, such as the regularization strength and tree depth.

Finally, we evaluated the model's performance on the testing set and generated a confusion matrix and classification report to analyze the model's precision, recall, and f1-score.

Requirements
The code is written in Python 3. You need to have the following libraries installed to run the code:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
You can install them using pip:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn

Usage
To run the code, download the repository and navigate to the project directory. Then run the following command:
python churn_prediction.py

This will train the machine learning model and output the evaluation metrics. You can also modify the code to tune the hyperparameters or try different algorithms.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how machine learning techniques can be used to predict customer churn for a telecom company. The code is open-source and can be used as a reference for similar projects. We welcome any feedback or contributions to the code.
